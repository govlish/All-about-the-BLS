# All-about-the-BLS
Our Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data set is an example of a Federal government agency taxonomy.
	From our Govlish Federal database, we construct agency taxonomy data sets that include all components, echelons, programs, position titles, systems, points of contact, word pronunciations as applicable, and more. We construct taxonomy data sets all across the Federal government.
